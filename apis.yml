  Vercel is a cloud platform that helps developers build, deploy, and scale
  modern web applications quickly and efficiently. It provides an optimized
  hosting environment for frontend frameworks like Next.js (which it created),
  as well as other React, Vue, Angular, and static site projects. Vercel
  automates workflows for continuous deployment, edge caching, and serverless
  functions, so developers can push code changes and see them live almost
  instantly. Its focus is on performance, collaboration, and simplicity making
  it easy for teams to preview every pull request, collaborate on design and
  development, and deliver fast, reliable experiences to users worldwide.
